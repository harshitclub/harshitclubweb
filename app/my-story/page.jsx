        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, My Name is Harshit Kumar, I am currently a Full Stack Web
          Developer who build real-life dynamic websites and web applications
          using latest technologies like React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India. I was a average student
          throughout my academic journey, but I never let my grades define my
          abilities or limit my potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you ready to join me on an exciting journey? Let's dive in and
          explore how I discovered my passion for programming and business, and
          how I became the full stack web developer I am today.
        </p>
        <h2>First Computer Interaction</h2>
        <p>
          It all started in the year 2009 when I was just a little kid in my
          play school. I still remember the day when my computer teacher took us
          all to the computer lab for the first time. As I entered the lab, I
          saw all those big monitors, CPUs and wires which looked so fascinating
          to me. That was my first encounter with computers and I was mesmerized
          by the technology that I had just seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          My teacher then showed us how to operate a computer and asked us to
          type our names on the keyboard. I was thrilled and excited at the same
          time to try my hands on it. With some guidance from my teacher, I
          managed to type my name "Harshit Kumar" on the screen. It was such a
          memorable experience for me that I can still feel the thrill of that
          moment.
        </p>
        <h2>My Early Years with Computers</h2>
        <p>
          When my uncle purchased a computer machine in around 2012, it was like
          a dream come true for me. However, my excitement was short-lived when
          my father and uncle forbade me from touching the computer and say that
          Harshit you are too young to handle such an expensive machine.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my curiosity got the better of me and I started exploring the
          computer when no one was at home. I learned how to play games and
          started experimenting with various computer functions.{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>First Internet Interaction</h2>
        <p>
          The moment when I had my first internet interaction was a turning
          point in my life. It was in the year 2012 when my father had purchased
          a simple keypad mobile phone for my mother.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I was intrigued by the phone's browser app but didn't know how to use
          it. Every time I tried opening the app, an error message popped up. I
          was clueless until my best friend showed me how to use the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked me to type anything in the search bar, and the browser
          provided information about that keyword. It was like magic, and I felt
          like I had entered a whole new world. From that day onwards, I was
          fascinated by the power of the internet and started exploring it more.
        </p>
        <p>
          After my first interaction with the internet on my mother's mobile
          phone, I was curious to explore more. Despite my father's reservations
          about my age and readiness to use the internet, I was determined to
          learn more.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>How My Father Tell Me About Modem</h3>
        <p>
          My father did tell me about a dongle that could be used to connect to
          the internet on a computer, which my uncle used. I couldn't wait to
          try it out, but I had to wait for the perfect opportunity.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, one day when my uncle was not at home, I seized the chance
          and took the modem or dongle to my uncle's computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plugged the dongle into the CPU and, with some effort, managed to
          connect the computer to the internet. This was a groundbreaking moment
          for me, as it opened up a whole new world of knowledge and
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned how to use Google to search for anything and everything, and
          how to find data and information on the internet. It was like a window
          to the world had opened up for me, and I was eager to learn more and
          more.
        </p>
        <h2>Doing Silly Things With Best Friend</h2>
        <p>
          I was in 5th grade I met my best friend name "Deepanshu Verma" who was
          already a computer enthusiast. He knew how to use computers and mainly
          how to play games on them. He introduced me to the world of gaming by
          showing me games like GTA Vice City and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          He taught me how to play games on the computer and also introduced me
          to various computer components such as RAM, hard disk, graphic card,
          processor, and more. With his help, I learned a lot about computers
          and was able to explore new things that I didn't know before.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a great mentor and helped me to develop my interest in
          computers and technology. Thanks to him, I was able to gain a lot of
          knowledge that has helped me in my career as a web developer.
        </p>
        <h3>Using Hard Disk As a Pendrive</h3>
        <p>
          It's common for children to come up with creative solutions to
          problems, even if those solutions might seem unusual or even
          unorthodox to adults. That's exactly what happened when my best friend
          Deepanshu and I needed to transfer data between our computers, but we
          didn't have a pendrive handy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, we decided to unplug the hard disk from Deepanshu's computer
          and plug it into my computer's CPU in place of the DVD writer. It was
          a silly thing to do, but it worked for us at the time. Looking back,
          it's a funny memory that we still laugh about today.
        </p>
        <h2>Interest In Websites</h2>
        <p>
          In 2017, when I was in 9th grade, I stumbled upon the idea of making
          money by building websites and blogging on the internet. I was
          intrigued by this concept and wanted to explore it further. I started
          doing some research and found out that there are many people out there
          who have made a successful career out of building websites and
          blogging.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I was determined to learn everything I could about web development and
          blogging. I spent countless hours reading blogs and watching
          tutorials. Then somehow I created my first website using a CMS, I was
          so happy at that time.
        </p>
        <h2>How I Found My Passion</h2>
        <p>
          When I began my 10th grade, I was searching for something that would
          pique my interest. During the initial days, I was given free time to
          do whatever I wanted in the classroom. With only my IT book in hand, I
          started to read it.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As I delved deeper, I came across a short introduction about some of
          the tech pioneers like Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Bill Gates, Sundar
          Pichai, and Satya Nadella. Their stories fascinated me.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          As I continued reading, I stumbled upon the section on HTML. Within
          minutes, I realized that programming and business were my calling.
          This discovery set me on a path of lifelong learning and exploration.
        </p>
        <h3>How My Computer Teacher Impressed By Me</h3>
        <p>
          In 10th grade, I discovered my passion for coding and business, and
          started learning about HTML and CSS to build some basic but beautiful
          web pages. During a computer lab session, I decided to show my
          computer teacher what I had created.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As she saw my work, my computer teacher was genuinely impressed and
          appreciated my efforts and says "Harshit how you make these web
          pages!" in front of the whole class. I can still remember that moment
          - it was amazing. From that day on, everyone in the class knew me as
          the person with impressive computer skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even people who had never talked to me before suddenly wanted to
          strike up a conversation with me. The appreciation and recognition I
          received from my teacher and classmates for my computer skills made me
          even more determined to pursue my passion for coding and business.
        </p>
        <h2>I Don't Want To Become a Doctor or Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          In India, it is a common belief among parents that their children
          should pursue a career in either medicine or engineering. This was the
          case with my parents as well. However, I had a different vision for my
          future. I wanted to become a businessman.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I shared my aspirations with my parents, they were taken aback.
          They expressed their concerns about the risks involved in starting a
          business, the amount of capital required, and the potential for
          failure. My father even went as far as to say that only the wealthy
          can afford to start a business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite their apprehension, I remained steadfast in my decision. I was
          determined to pursue my dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur. I
          made it clear to my parents that business was my passion, and I was
          willing to take calculated risks to achieve my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not an easy conversation, and my parents were understandably
          worried about my future. However, I knew in my heart that I had made
          the right decision. I was willing to put in the hard work, take
          calculated risks, and learn from my mistakes.
        </p>
        <h2>Move In a Different City</h2>
        <p>
          In 2022, I realized that I needed to support my ideas financially and
          gain some work experience while still pursuing my college studies.
          After giving it some thought, I decided to explore job opportunities
          in web development, as I was already familiar with basic MERN Stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started looking for job openings and finally landed a job as a web
          developer in 3a Learning Solutions India Pvt. Ltd. I was thrilled to
          start my professional journey as a web developer while still studying
          in college.
        </p>
