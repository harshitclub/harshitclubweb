Welcome to a comprehensive guide on JavaScript data types. As a fundamental concept in programming, data types are the foundation upon which your code is built. They determine how your data is stored, processed and manipulated. In this guide, we'll explore the different data types in JavaScript, from numbers and strings to more complex objects.

Whether you're a newbie looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer looking for a refresher, this resource will equip you with the knowledge and insight you need to make informed decisions about data management in JavaScript. Get ready to dive deeper into the world of data types and increase your proficiency in this essential aspect of web development.

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types in JavaScript are the most basic building blocks for storing and manipulating data. They include numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, and null.

These data types are simple, immutable values that represent fundamental entities in your code. They are not objects and have no methods or properties of their own. Understanding primitive data types is essential for working with JavaScript effectively.

### <span>01.</span> Number

In JavaScript, the "Number" data type is used to represent numeric values. It encompasses both integers and floating-point numbers, allowing us to work with a wide range of numerical values.

#### Here are some key characteristics and details about the Number data type:

- **Integer and Floating-Point Numbers**: The Number data type includes both whole numbers (integers) and numbers with decimal points (floating-point numbers). For example, 42 and 3.14 are both instances of the Number data type.
- **Not Limited by Size**: JavaScript does not impose a fixed size for Number values, which means we can work with very large or very small numbers. This is different from some other programming languages that have fixed-size integer types.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: We can perform standard arithmetic operations with Number values, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Mathematical Functions**: JavaScript provides a rich set of built-in mathematical functions and constants that can be used with Number values. These include functions like `Math.sqrt()`, `Math.pow()`, and constants like `Math.PI`.
- **NaN (Not-a-Number)**: JavaScript also has a special value called "NaN" to represent results that are "not-a-number." It typically arises from operations that don't produce valid numbers, like dividing by zero or attempting to parse a non-numeric string.
- **Infinity and -Infinity**: JavaScript supports positive and negative infinity as valid Number values, which can be the result of certain calculations, such as dividing a non-zero number by zero.
- **Rounding and Precision**: Floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript follows the IEEE 754 standard, which can lead to some precision issues. It's important to be aware of potential rounding errors when working with floating-point numbers.
- **Type Conversion**: JavaScript allows us to convert other data types to Numbers using functions like` Number()`. Implicit type coercion can also convert other types to Numbers in certain situations.

```jsx
let integerNumber = 42;
let floatingPointNumber = 3.14;

let result = integerNumber + floatingPointNumber;
console.log(result); // Outputs: 45.14
```

In this example, we have both an integer and a floating-point Number, and we perform an arithmetic operation on them.

### <span>02.</span> String

In JavaScript, the "String" data type is used to represent and manipulate textual data. It allows you to work with sequences of characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

#### Here are key details about the String data type:

- **Character Sequences**: A string is essentially a sequence of characters enclosed within single (' '), double (" "), or backticks ( ` `) quotes. For example, 'Hello, World!', "JavaScript", and `Backticks` are all strings.
- **Immutable**: Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed once they are created. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.
- **Concatenation**: We can concatenate strings using the `+` operator. For example, `"Hello, " + "World!"` results in the string "Hello, World!".
- **Length Property**: Strings have a length property that indicates the number of characters in the string. For example, `"JavaScript".length` returns 10.
- **Indexing**: We can access individual characters within a string using bracket notation. For example, `"JavaScript"[0]` returns "J".
- **String Methods**: JavaScript provides a wide range of built-in string methods to manipulate and process strings, such as `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `split()`, `replace()`, and many others.
- **Escape Characters**: We can use escape characters like `\n` (newline), `\t` (tab), and `\\` (backslash) to represent special characters within a string.
- **Template Literals**: Enclosed within backticks (``), template literals allow us to create multi-line strings and embed variables directly within the string using `${}` placeholders.

```jsx
let greeting = "Hello,";
let name = "Alice";

let message = `${greeting} ${name}!`; // Using a template literal

console.log(message); // Outputs: "Hello, Alice!"
```

JavaScript can implicitly or explicitly convert other data types to strings, making it easy to concatenate or manipulate data with string operations.

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>03.</span> Boolean

In JavaScript, the "Boolean" data type is used to represent values that can have one of two states: `true` or `false`. Booleans are fundamental for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Boolean data type:

- **True or False**: A Boolean variable can only hold one of two values: `true` or `false`. These values are case-sensitive, so true and True are not the same.
- **Logical Operations**: Booleans are often used in conditional statements and logical operations. For example, we can use them in `if` statements to control the flow of our program based on whether a condition is true or false.

```jsx
let isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("Bring an umbrella!");
} else {
  console.log("No need for an umbrella.");
}

// Output: Bring an umbrella!
```

- **Comparison Operators**: Many operations in JavaScript, such as comparisons and equality checks, result in Boolean values. For example, 5 > 3 returns true, and 7 === "7" returns false.
- **Logical Operators**: JavaScript provides logical operators like `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT) to combine and manipulate Boolean values.

```jsx
let sunny = true;
let warm = false;

if (sunny && warm) {
  console.log("Perfect day!");
}
```

- **Type Conversion**: Data from other types can be implicitly converted to Booleans. In JavaScript, most values are "truthy," meaning they are considered true in a Boolean context, except for a few "falsy" values like false, 0, null, undefined, and empty strings.

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>04.</span> Undefined

In JavaScript, the "Undefined" data type represents a variable or value that has been declared but has not been assigned any value. It is often used to signify that a variable exists, but its content is missing or unknown.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Undefined data type:

- **Default Value**: When a variable is declared but not initialized, it automatically receives the value undefined. For example:

```jsx
let name;
console.log(name); // Outputs: undefined
```

- **Function Return**: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it is considered to return undefined by default.

```jsx
function greet() {
  // No return statement
}

let result = greet();
console.log(result); // Outputs: undefined
```

- **Missing Properties**: When trying to access an object property that doesn't exist, the result is undefined.

```jsx
let person = {
  name: "Harshit",
  age: 22,
};

console.log(person.address); // Outputs: undefined
```

- **Indicating Absence**: Developers often use undefined to signify that something is missing or has not been set.

```jsx
let phone;

if (phone === undefined) {
  console.log("Phone number is not provided.");
}

// output: Phone number is not provided.
```

- **Type and Value**: undefined is both a value and a data type in JavaScript.

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>05.</span> Null

In JavaScript, the "null" data type is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value or the lack of a value. It's often used to signify that a variable should have no value, and it's distinct from the "undefined" data type.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the null data type:

- **Intentional Absence**: The `null` data type is typically assigned to variables or properties when we want to explicitly indicate that there is no value or that the value is unknown or irrelevant.

```jsx
let age = null; // Variable with no age information
```

- **Type and Value**: `Null` is both a value and a data type in JavaScript. It is an object.
- **No Properties or Methods**: A variable with a value of `null` does not have any properties or methods associated with it. For example, if we try to access properties or methods on a null value, it will result in an error.
- **Comparison to undefined**: `Null` is often used in contrast to the undefined data type. While undefined indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned any value, null signifies that a variable has been intentionally set to no value.
- **Garbage Collection**: When a variable is set to `null`, it can indicate to the JavaScript engine that the object can be garbage-collected, freeing up memory.

```jsx
let data = fetchData(); // Some data retrieval function

data = null; // Data is no longer needed and can be garbage-collected
```

- **Clearing Object References**: Null is commonly used to clear object references, allowing the objects to be collected by the garbage collector when they are no longer needed.

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>06.</span> BigInt

In JavaScript, the "BigInt" data type is used to represent large integers, specifically, integers that are larger than the maximum value that can be accurately represented by the standard "Number" data type. BigInts are often needed for handling extremely large or precise numeric values.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the BigInt data type:

- **Integer Values**: BigInts can only represent integer values, and they are not suitable for handling floating-point numbers.
- **Suffix "n"**: To create a BigInt literal, we append the letter "n" to the end of an integer value. For example, `const bigIntValue = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n`;
- **Arbitrary Precision**: BigInts have arbitrary precision, meaning they can represent extremely large integers without losing accuracy. This is in contrast to the standard "Number" data type, which has a fixed limit of precision.
- **Math Operations**: BigInts can be used in various mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, just like regular numbers.

```jsx
const bigIntA = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
const bigIntB = 9876543210987654321098765432109876543210n;

const sum = bigIntA + bigIntB;
console.log(sum); // Outputs a BigInt: 11111111111111111101111111110011111111100n
```

- **Compatibility**: While BigInts provide enhanced precision, they are not compatible with standard arithmetic operations that involve regular "Number" values. We need to convert BigInts or use them in a BigInt context.
- **String to BigInt**: We can convert a string to a BigInt using the `BigInt()` constructor.

```jsx
const bigIntFromString = BigInt("1234567890123456789012345678901234567890");
```

- **Type Checking**: We can check if a value is a BigInt using the `typeof` operator.

```jsx
const value = 42n;

console.log(typeof value === "bigint"); // Outputs: true
```

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>07.</span> Symbol

In JavaScript, the "Symbol" data type is a unique and immutable primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Symbols are often used to create property keys for objects, ensuring that they are unique and can't be accidentally overwritten.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Symbol data type:

- **Uniqueness**: Each symbol value is unique, even if two symbols have the same description. This uniqueness makes symbols valuable for creating property keys that won't conflict with other keys.
- `Immutability`: Symbols are immutable and cannot be changed or modified once created. This immutability is in contrast to strings, which can be altered.
- **Creation**: We can create a symbol using the `Symbol()` constructor. We can also provide an optional description (a string) as a parameter to describe the symbol, which can be useful for debugging.

```jsx
const symbol1 = Symbol();

const symbol2 = Symbol("mySymbol");
```

- **Symbol Descriptions**: Symbols with the same description are not equal, even though they have the same description. The description is mainly for debugging and doesn't affect the uniqueness of symbols.
- `Object Properties`: Symbols are commonly used as property keys for objects, making it easier to create private or non-enumerable object properties. This helps prevent accidental overwrites or collisions.

```jsx
const myObject = {};
const mySymbol = Symbol("mySymbol");

myObject[mySymbol] = "This is a symbol property";
```

- **Global Symbol Registry**: Symbols can be added to a global symbol registry to create shared symbols that can be accessed across different parts of our codebase.

```jsx
const globalSymbol = Symbol.for("globalSymbol");
```

- **Predefined Symbols**: JavaScript provides a set of predefined symbols as static properties of the Symbol constructor. These symbols are commonly used for specific operations, such as symbol iteration.

```jsx
const iteratorSymbol = Symbol.iterator; // Used for custom iteration in objects
```

- **Type Checking**: You can use the typeof operator to determine if a value is a symbol.

```jsx
const value = Symbol();

console.log(typeof value === "symbol"); // Outputs: true
```

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
## Reference Data Types

Reference data types in JavaScript are more complex data structures that can hold multiple values and have methods and properties. These include objects, arrays, functions, and more. Unlike primitive data types, reference types are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed after creation.

These types are stored by reference, and when you assign a reference type to a new variable, you are actually referencing the same underlying data. Understanding reference data types is important for working with complex data structures in JavaScript.

### <span>01.</span> Object

In JavaScript, the "Object" data type is a complex and versatile data type that is used to represent structured data in the form of key-value pairs. Objects are fundamental to the language and are used to store and organize data as properties and methods.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Object data type:

- **Key-Value Pairs**: Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key (also known as a property) is associated with a value. The key is typically a string or a symbol, and the value can be of any data type, including other objects.

```jsx
const person = {
  name: "Harshit",
  age: 22,
  isStudent: false,
};
```

- **Dynamic Properties**: Object properties can be added, updated, or deleted dynamically during the execution of a program.

```jsx
person.job = "Engineer"; // Add a new property
person.age = 21; // Update an existing property
delete person.isStudent; // Delete a property
```

- **Accessing Properties**: We can access object properties using dot notation or square brackets.

```jsx
console.log(person.name); // Dot notation

console.log(person["age"]); // Square brackets
```

- **Methods**: In addition to properties, objects can also contain methods, which are functions stored as object properties.

```jsx
const calculator = {
  add: function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  },
};
```

- **Prototype Chain**: Objects in JavaScript can inherit properties and methods from a prototype object, creating a prototype chain. This is the basis of inheritance in JavaScript.
- **JSON**: Objects can be easily converted to and from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), making them a popular choice for data serialization and deserialization.
- **Data Structures**: Objects can be used to create a wide range of data structures, including arrays, stacks, queues, and more complex data structures like linked lists and trees.
- **Enumeration**: We can enumerate object properties using loops or methods like `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`.

```jsx
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]);
}
```

- **Object Constructors**: We can create objects using constructor functions or class constructors in JavaScript. These are often used for creating multiple objects with similar structures.

```jsx
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const john = new Person("Harshit", 22);
```

- **Type Checking**: We can use the typeof operator to determine if a value is an object. However, this doesn't distinguish between objects and null.

```jsx
console.log(typeof person === "object"); // Outputs: true
```

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>02.</span> Array

In JavaScript, the "Array" data type is a specialized object used to store and manage ordered collections of values. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in the language and offer various methods for working with lists of data.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Array data type:

- **Ordered Collection**: Arrays are ordered collections of values, where each value is assigned a numeric index (starting from 0) that determines its position within the array.

```jsx
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

- **Mixed Data Types**: Arrays can store values of different data types, including numbers, strings, objects, functions, and other arrays. This flexibility allows for the creation of heterogeneous arrays.

```jsx
const mixedArray = [42, "hello", true, { key: "value" }, [1, 2, 3]];
```

- **Dynamic Length**: Arrays can grow or shrink dynamically by adding or removing elements. The `push()` method appends an element to the end of the array, and the `pop()` method removes the last element.

```jsx
fruits.push("date"); // Add an element to the end

fruits.pop(); // Remove the last element
```

- **Access by Index**: We can access array elements by their index using square brackets.

```jsx
console.log(fruits[1]); // Outputs: 'banana'
```

- **Length Property**: Arrays have a length property that indicates the number of elements in the array.

```jsx
console.log(fruits.length); // Outputs: 3
```

- **Iteration**: Arrays can be iterated over using loops like `for`, `for...of`, or array-specific methods like `forEach()`.

```jsx
fruits.forEach(function (fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});
```

- **Array Methods**: JavaScript provides a rich set of array methods for performing various operations on arrays, including sorting, filtering, mapping, reducing, and more.

```jsx
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3];

const sortedNumbers = numbers.sort(); // Sorts the array in place
```

- **Type Checking**: We can use the `Array.isArray()` method to determine if a value is an array.

```jsx
console.log(Array.isArray(fruits)); // Outputs: true
```

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>03.</span> Function

In JavaScript, the "Function" data type is a first-class object that represents a callable unit of code. Functions are a fundamental building block of the language and play a central role in defining and executing reusable blocks of code.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Function data type:

- **First-Class Citizens**: Functions are considered first-class citizens in JavaScript, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.

```jsx
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

const result = add(5, 3); // Calling the functionjsx
```

- **Function Declaration**: Functions can be defined using the function keyword, followed by a name, a list of parameters, and a function body enclosed in curly braces. Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be used before they are declared in the code.

```jsx
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

- **Function Expressions**: Functions can also be created as expressions, which are often assigned to variables or passed directly as arguments to other functions. These functions are not hoisted.

```jsx
const multiply = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
```

- **Anonymous Functions**: Functions can be created without a name, known as anonymous functions. These are often used as callback functions or immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE).

```jsx
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This is an anonymous function.");
}, 1000);
```

- **Arrow Functions**: ES6 introduced arrow functions, which provide a concise syntax for defining functions. They are often used for short, one-liner functions.

```jsx
const square = (x) => x * x;
```

- **Function Parameters**: Functions can accept zero or more parameters (inputs) and can return a value (output). Parameters are local variables within the function.
- **Return Statement**: Functions can use the return statement to specify the value that the function should return. If no return statement is used, the function returns undefined.
- **Closures**: Functions can "remember" and access variables from the outer (enclosing) scope in which they were created. This behavior is known as a closure and is a powerful feature for creating private variables and encapsulating behavior.
- **Recursive Functions**: Functions can call themselves, creating a recursive function. Recursive functions are used for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar subtasks.

```jsx
function factorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as values. These are called higher-order functions and are commonly used for tasks like mapping, filtering, and reducing arrays.

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squared = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
```

- **Function Scopes**: Functions have their own scope, and variables declared within a function are not accessible from outside the function. This scope is often referred to as a local scope.

Functions are a core concept in JavaScript and are essential for organizing and structuring code, enabling code reusability, and implementing logic in JavaScript programs. Understanding how to create, use, and work with functions is fundamental to any JavaScript developer.

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>04.</span> Date

In JavaScript, the "Date" data type is used to work with dates and times. It allows you to represent, manipulate, and perform operations on dates, times, and time intervals.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Date data type:

- **Creating Date Objects**: You can create a Date object using the `new Date()` constructor, which can take various arguments, such as a specific date, time, or both. If no arguments are provided, it creates a Date object representing the current date and time.

```jsx
const currentDate = new Date(); // Current date and time
const specificDate = new Date("2023-10-31"); // Specific date
const dateAndTime = new Date(2023, 9, 31, 12, 0, 0); // Specific date and time
```

- **Date Methods**: Date objects have various methods to extract and manipulate date and time components, including `getYear()`, `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`, `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, and more.

```jsx
const year = currentDate.getFullYear();
const month = currentDate.getMonth();
const day = currentDate.getDate();
```

- **Formatting Dates**: To format a date as a string, we can use methods like `toDateString()`, `toTimeString()`, `toLocaleDateString()`, and `toLocaleTimeString()`. These methods provide human-readable date and time representations.

```jsx
const dateString = currentDate.toDateString();
const timeString = currentDate.toTimeString();
```

- **Working with Time Zones**: JavaScript Date objects are sensitive to time zones. We can set the time zone offset using the setTimezoneOffset() method and work with time zones in your applications.
- **Arithmetic with Dates**: We can perform arithmetic operations with dates, such as adding or subtracting days, months, or milliseconds to/from a date using mathematical operations and the relevant Date methods.

```jsx
const tomorrow = new Date();

tomorrow.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
```

- **Comparing Dates**: We can compare dates to determine which one is earlier or later using comparison operators (e.g., `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) or by converting dates to timestamps using the `getTime()` method.
- **Date Validation**: We can validate dates to check if they are valid using the `isNaN()` function or by comparing the date with itself.

```jsx
function isValidDate(d) {
  return d instanceof Date && !isNaN(d);
}
```

- **Unix Timestamp**: Date objects can be converted to Unix timestamps using the `getTime()` method, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix epoch).

```jsx
const unixTimestamp = currentDate.getTime();
```

- **Working with Intervals**: We can create time intervals and calculate the difference between two dates. The Date object also allows us to measure time intervals.
- **Locale-Specific Date Formatting**: JavaScript provides methods like `toLocaleDateString()` and `toLocaleTimeString()` to format dates and times according to the user's locale and language settings.

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>05.</span> RegExp

In JavaScript, the "RegExp" data type, short for Regular Expression, is a powerful tool for working with text patterns. Regular expressions are used to search, match, and manipulate strings based on patterns and rules. They provide a flexible and concise way to define and identify text patterns within strings.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the RegExp data type:

- **Creating Regular Expressions**: We can create a regular expression by enclosing a pattern in forward slashes (e.g., `/pattern/`). Regular expressions can also be created using the RegExp constructor function.

```jsx
const pattern1 = /apple/;
const pattern2 = new RegExp("banana");
```

- **Matching Patterns**: Regular expressions are used to match patterns within strings. The `test()` method checks if a string matches a pattern and returns a boolean.

```jsx
const text = "I love apples.";
const pattern = /apple/;

const isMatch = pattern.test(text); // true
```

- **Searching and Replacing**: Regular expressions can be used with string methods like `search()`, `match()`, and `replace()` to search for and manipulate text based on patterns.

```jsx
const text = "I have two apples and three bananas.";

const pattern = /\d+/g;

const numbers = text.match(pattern); // ['2', '3']*

const updatedText = text.replace(pattern, "some"); // 'I have some apples and some bananas.'
```

- **Regular Expression Patterns**: Patterns can include special characters with special meanings, such as `.` (any character), `*` (zero or more occurrences), `+` (one or more occurrences), `?` (zero or one occurrence), and more.
- **Character Classes**: Character classes allow us to specify a range of characters or specific character sets. For example, [0-9] matches any digit, and [a-zA-Z] matches any letter.
- **Modifiers**: Regular expressions can include modifiers like `i` (case-insensitive), `g` (global), and `m` (multiline) to control how the pattern is applied.

```jsx
const pattern = /apple/gi;
```

- **Anchors**: Anchors like `^` (start of the string) and `$` (end of the string) allow us to match patterns at the beginning or end of a string.
- **Quantifiers**: Quantifiers like `{n}` and `{n, m}` allow us to specify exact repetitions or a range of repetitions.

```jsx
const pattern = /\d{2,4}/;
```

- **Capture Groups**: We can use parentheses to create capture groups within a regular expression to extract specific parts of a matched string.

```jsx
const text = "My email is harshit@harshitclub.com";
const pattern = /(\w+)@(\w+\.\w+)/;
const match = text.match(pattern); // ['harshit@harshitclub.com', 'harshit', 'harshit.com']
```

- **Predefined Character Classes**: Regular expressions include predefined character classes like `\d` (digits), `\w` (word characters), and `\s` (whitespace).

<div className="blogSpace"></div>
### <span>06.</span> Map

In JavaScript, the "Map" data type is a collection of key-value pairs that allows us to store and manage data in an associative manner. Maps are used for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, and they are particularly useful when we need to store data with custom keys and easily access it.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Map data type:

- **Key-Value Storage**: A Map consists of a set of key-value pairs, where each key is unique within the Map, and it is associated with a corresponding value.
- **Key Types**: Keys in a Map can be of any data type, including primitive types (e.g., strings, numbers), objects, and even functions. This flexibility allows us to use custom and complex data as keys.

```jsx
const myMap = new Map();

const key1 = "name";
const key2 = { id: 1 };
const key3 = function () {
  return "key3";
};

myMap.set(key1, "Harshit");
myMap.set(key2, "Value associated with an object");
myMap.set(key3, "Value associated with a function");
```

- **Iterating Over Entries**: We can easily iterate through the entries in a Map using methods like `forEach()`, `for...of` loops, or by accessing the `entries()` method. This allows us to process and manipulate data efficiently.

```jsx
myMap.forEach((value, key) => {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
});

for (const [key, value] of myMap) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
```

- **Size and Empty Check**: The size property allows us to determine the number of entries in the Map. We can check if a Map is empty by verifying whether its size is zero.

```jsx
const isEmpty = myMap.size === 0;
```

- **Accessing Values**: We can access values in a Map using their associated keys. The `get()` method allows us to retrieve the value associated with a specific key.

```jsx
const value = myMap.get(key1); // 'Harshit'
```

- **Checking for Key Existence**: We can determine whether a specific key exists in the Map using the `has()` method.

```jsx
const keyExists = myMap.has(key2); // true
```

- **Deletion**: We can remove a specific key-value pair from the Map using the `delete()` method. To clear all entries in the Map, use the `clear()` method.

```jsx
myMap.delete(key1); // Removes the entry associated with key1
myMap.clear(); // Clears all entries in the Map
```

- **Order of Keys**: Keys in a Map are ordered based on their insertion order, making it possible to maintain the sequence of entries.
- **Use Cases**: Maps are commonly used for various purposes, including managing configurations, caching data, storing metadata, and associating data with specific objects or functions.

#### Map vs. Object

While Maps and objects may seem similar, Maps offer advantages when it comes to handling keys of various data types, maintaining key order, and providing built-in methods for easy manipulation.

### <span>07.</span> Set

In JavaScript, the "Set" data type is a collection of unique values, which means that it can only contain distinct elements. Sets are used for managing data without allowing duplicate entries, making them especially useful for tasks that involve eliminating duplicates or checking for the existence of values in a collection.

#### Here are the key characteristics of the Set data type:

- **Unique Values**: Sets can only store unique values, which means that any given value can occur in the Set only once. Duplicates are automatically removed.

```jsx
const mySet = new Set();

mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(2);
mySet.add(2); // Duplicate value, ignored
```

- **Data Types**: Sets can hold values of any data type, including primitive types (e.g., numbers, strings), objects, and even functions.

```jsx
const mixedSet = new Set();

mixedSet.add("apple");
mixedSet.add(42);
mixedSet.add({ name: "John" });
mixedSet.add(() => "Hello, world!");
```

- **Checking for Existence**: We can easily check whether a specific value exists in a Set using the `has()` method. This is a quick and efficient way to search for values.

```jsx
const hasValue = mySet.has(2); // true
const notFound = mySet.has(3); // false
```

- **Size and Empty Check**: The size property allows us to determine the number of unique values in the Set. We can check if a Set is empty by verifying whether its size is zero.

```jsx
const isEmpty = mySet.size === 0;
```

- **Iterating Over Values**: Sets can be easily iterated using methods like `forEach()`, `for...of` loops, or by accessing the `values()` method. This allows us to process and manipulate unique values efficiently.

```jsx
mySet.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});

for (const value of mySet) {
  console.log(value);
}
```

- **Deletion**: We can remove a specific value from the Set using the `delete()` method. To clear all values from the Set, use the `clear()` method.

```jsx
mySet.delete(2); // Removes the value 2
mySet.clear(); // Clears all values from the Set
```

- **Order of Values**: Values in a Set are maintained in the order they were added. The order of insertion is respected, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
- **Use Cases**: Sets are commonly used for tasks like removing duplicates from arrays, checking for the existence of values in collections, and storing unique values when the order doesn't matter.
